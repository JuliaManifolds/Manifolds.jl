An abstract type to represent the field matrix manifolds are build upon, following the idea
of [TensorKit](https://github.com/Jutho/TensorKit.jl) in order to have concrete field types
to dispatch on. The two most common field types are [`RealNumbers`](@ref) (`ℝ` for short)
and [`ComplexNumbers`](@ref) (`ℂ`).
