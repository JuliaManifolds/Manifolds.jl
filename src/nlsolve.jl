Given a manifold `M`, two points `p` and `q` on the manifold, and an initial guess `X0` at
the vector $X âˆˆ T_p M$, such that `q == retract(M, p, X)`, solve for `X` in-place using a
nonlinear solver. Note that this method is not guaranteed to succeed and probably will not
unless `q` is in some small neighborhood around `p` and the initial guess `X0` is good.
If the solver fails to converge, a warning is raised.
