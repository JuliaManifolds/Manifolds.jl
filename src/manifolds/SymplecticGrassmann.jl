    SymplecticGrassmann{𝔽, T} <: AbstractEmbeddedManifold{𝔽, DefaultIsometricEmbeddingType}

The symplectic Grassmann manifold consists of all symplectic subspaces of
``ℝ^{2n}`` of dimension ``2k``, ``n ≥ k``.

Points on this manifold can be represented as corresponding representers on the [`SymplecticStiefel`](@ref)

```math
\operatorname{SpGr}(2n,2k) = \bigl\{ \operatorname{span}(p)\ \big| \ p ∈ \operatorname{SpSt}(2n, 2k, ℝ)\},
```

or as projectors

```math
\operatorname{SpGr}(2n, 2k, ℝ) = \bigl\{ p ∈ ℝ^{2n×2n} \ \big| \ p^2 = p, \operatorname{rank}(p) = 2k, p^+=p \bigr\},
```

where ``⋅^+`` is the [`symplectic_inverse`](@ref).
See also [`ProjectorPoint`](@ref) and [`StiefelPoint`](@ref) for these two representations,
where arrays are interpreted as those on the Stiefel manifold.

With respect to the quotient structure, the canonical projection ``π = π_{\mathrm{SpSt},\mathrm{SpGr}}`` is given by

```math
π: \mathrm{SpSt}(2n2k) → \mathrm{SpGr}(2n,2k), p ↦ π(p) = pp^+.
```

The tangent space is either the tangent space from the symplectic Stiefel manifold, where
tangent vectors are representers of their corresponding congruence classes, or for the
representation as projectors, using a [`ProjectorTangentVector`](@ref) as

```math
  T_p\operatorname{SpGr}(2n, 2k, ℝ) =
  \bigl\{ [X,p] \ \mid\ X ∈ \mathfrak{sp}(2n,ℝ), Xp+pX = X \bigr\},
```

where ``[X,p] = Xp-pX`` denotes the matrix commutator and
``\mathfrak{sp}(2n,ℝ)`` is the Lie algebra of the symplectic group consisting of [`HamiltonianMatrices`](@ref).

The first representation is in [`StiefelPoint`](@ref)s and [`StiefelTangentVector`](@ref)s,
which both represent their symplectic Grassmann equivalence class. Arrays are interpreted
in this representation as well

For the representation in [`ProjectorPoint`](@ref) and [`ProjectorTangentVector`](@ref)s,
we use the representation from the surjective submersion

```math
ρ: \mathrm{SpSt}(2n,2k) → \mathrm{SpGr}(2n,2k),
\qquad
ρ(p) = pp^+
```

and its differential

```math
\mathrm{d}ρ(p,X) = Xp^+ + pX^+,
```

respectively.
The manifold was first introduced in [BendokatZimmermann:2021](@cite)
