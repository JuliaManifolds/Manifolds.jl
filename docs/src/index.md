# Manifolds

Package __Manifolds__ aims to provide both a unified interface to define and
use manifolds as well as a library of manifolds to use for your projects.

## Interface

```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds]
Pages = ["Manifolds.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function]
```

## Decorators
### ArrayManifold
```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds]
Pages = ["ArrayManifold.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function]
```
### Lie Group
```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds]
Pages = ["Group.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function]
```

### Metric
```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds]
Pages = ["Metric.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function]
```
