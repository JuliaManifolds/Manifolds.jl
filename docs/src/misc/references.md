# Literature

We are slowly moving to using [`DocumenterCitations.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/DocumenterCitations.jl/).
The goal is to have all references used / mentioned in the documentation of Manifolds.jl also listed here.
If you notice a reference still defined in a footnote, please change it into a BibTeX reference and [open a PR](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/Manifolds.jl/compare)

Usually you will find a small reference section at the end of every documentation page that contains references for just that page.
