# [Euclidean space](@id EuclideanSection)

The Euclidean space $ℝ^n$ is a simple model space, since it has curvature constantly zero everywhere; hence, nearly all operations simplify.
The easiest way to generate an Euclidean space is to use a field, i.e. [`AbstractNumbers`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldsBase.jl/stable/types.html#number-system), e.g. to create the $ℝ^n$ or $ℝ^{n\times n}$ you can simply type `M = ℝ^n` or `ℝ^(n,n)`, respectively.
