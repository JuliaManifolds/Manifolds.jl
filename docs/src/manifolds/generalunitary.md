# Orthogonal and Unitary matrices

Both [`OrthogonalMatrices`](@ref) and [`UnitaryMatrices`](@ref) have similar formulae and implementations, as are [`Rotations`](@ref), as well as unitary matrices with determinant equal to one. These share a [common implementation](@ref Manifolds.GeneralUnitaryMatrices).

## Orthogonal matrices
