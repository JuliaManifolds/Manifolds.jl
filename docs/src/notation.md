# Notation overview

Since manifolds include a reasonable amount of elements and functions, the following list tries to keep an overview of used notation throughout `Manifolds.jl`.
The order is alphabetically by name.
They might be used in a plain form within the code or when referring to that code.
This is for example the case the calligraphic symbols.

Within the documented functions the utf8 symbols are used whenever possible,
as long as that renders still in $\TeX$ within this documentation.

| Symbol | Description | Also used | Comment |
|:--:|:-------------- |:--:|:--- |
| $T^*_p \mathcal M$ | The cotangent space at $p$ | | |
| $\xi$ | A cotangent vector from $T^*_p \mathcal M$ | $\xi_1, \xi_2,\ldots,\eta,\zeta$ | |
| $m$ | dimension (of a manifold) | $n_1,n_2,\ldots,m$| |
| $F$ | A fiber | | |
| $k$ | indices | $i,j$ | |
| $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ | inner product (in $T_p \mathcal M$) | $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_p, g_p(\cdot,\cdot)$ |
| $\mathcal M$ | A manifold | $\mathcal M_1, \mathcal M_2,\ldots,\mathcal N$ | |
| $\mathcal P_{q\gets p}X$ | parallel Transport |
| $p$ | A point on $\mathcal M$ | $p_1, p_2, \ldots,q$ | for 3 points one might use $x,y,z$ |
| $T_p \mathcal M$ | The tangent space at $p$ | | |
| $X$ | A tangent vector from $T_p \mathcal M$ | $X_1,X_2,\ldots,Y,Z$ | sometimes written with base point $X_p$. |
| $B$ | The Vector bundle | |
