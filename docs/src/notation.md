# Notation overview

Since manifolds include a reasonable amount of elements and functions, the
following list tries to keep an overview of used notation throughout `Manifolds.jl`.
The order by terminology. Thy might be used in a plain form within the code or
when referring to that code. This is for example the case the caligraphic symbols.

Within the documented functions the utf8 symbols are used whenever possible,
as long as that renders still in $\TeX$ within this documentation.

| Symbol | Description | Also used | Comment |
|:--:|:-------------- |:--:|:--- |
| ``T^*_x ℳ`` | The cotangent space at ``x`` | | |
| ``ξ`` | A cotangent vector from ``T^*_x ℳ`` | ``ξ_1,ξ_2,…,η,𝛇`` | |
| ``F`` | A fiber | |
| ``⟨·,·⟩`` | inner product (in ``T^*_x ℳ``) | ``⟨·,·⟩_x, g_x(·,·)`` |
| ``ℳ`` | A manifold | ``ℳ_1, ℳ_2,…,𝒩`` | |
| ``𝒫_{y\gets x}X`` | parallel Transport |
| ``x`` | A point on ℳ | ``x_1,x_2,…,y,z`` | |
| ``T_x ℳ`` | The tangent space at ``x`` | | |
| ``X`` | A tangent vector from ``T_x ℳ`` | ``X_1,X_2,…,Y,Z`` | sometimes with the base point in the index, ``X_x``. |
| ``B`` | The Vector bundle | |
