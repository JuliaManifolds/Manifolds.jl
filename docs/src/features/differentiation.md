# Differentiation

Documentation for `Manifolds.jl`'s methods and types for finite differences and automatic differentiation.

## Differentiation backends

```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds]
Pages = ["differentiation.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function, :constant]
```

## Riemannian differentiation backends

```@autodocs
Modules = [Manifolds]
Pages = ["riemannian_diff.jl"]
Order = [:type, :function, :constant]
```
