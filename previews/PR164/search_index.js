The tangent space at rotation R, T_R mathrmSO(n), is related to the tangent space at the identity rotation I_n by the differential of L_R at identity, (mathrmdL_R)_I_n  T_I_n mathrmSO(n)  T_R mathrmSO(n). For a tangent vector at the identity rotation X  T_I_n mathrmSO(n) the matrix representation of the corresponding tangent vector Y at a rotation R can be obtained by matrix multiplication: Y = RX  T_R mathrmSO(n). You can compare the functions log and exp to see how it works in practice.","category":"page"},{"location":"manifolds/rotations.html#","page":"Rotations","title":"Rotations","text":"Modules = [Manifolds]\nPages = [\"manifolds/Rotations.jl\"]\nOrder = [:type, :function]","category":"page"},{"location":"manifolds/rotations.html#Manifolds.Rotations","page":"Rotations","title":"Manifolds.Rotations","text":"Rotations{N} <: Manifold{ℝ}\n\nThe special orthogonal manifold mathrmSO(n) represented by n  n real-valued orthogonal matrices with determinant +1 is the manifold of Rotations, since these matrices represent all rotations of points in ℝ^n.\n\nConstructor\n\nRotations(n)\n\nGenerate the mathrmSO(n) subset ℝ^n  n\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"manifolds/rotations.html#Base.exp-Tuple{Rotations,Vararg{Any,N} where N}","page":"Rotations","title":"Base.exp","text":"exp(M::Rotations, p, X)\n\nCompute the exponential map on the Rotations from p into direction X, i.e.\n\nexp_p X = p operatornameExp(X)\n\nwhere operatornameExp(X)  denotes the matrix exponential of X.\n\nexp(M::Rotations{4}, p, X)\n\nCompute the exponential map of tangent vector X at point p from mathrmSO(4) manifold M.\n\nThe algorithm used is a more numerically stable form of those proposed in [Gallier2002] and [Andrica2013].\n\n[Gallier2002]: Gallier J.; Xu D.; Computing exponentials of skew-symmetric matrices and logarithms of orthogonal matrices.
