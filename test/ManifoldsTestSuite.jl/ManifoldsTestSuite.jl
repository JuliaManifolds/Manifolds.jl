    ManifoldsTestSuite.jl

An internal small module to encapsulate

* dummy types
* test functions
* a test suite

This is a slow work-in-progress to replace the `test_manifold` function,
and encapsulate and collect common tools for testing a manifold.

The current plan is to slowly move parts to this test suite whenever revising some tests orÂ¨
time permits.
